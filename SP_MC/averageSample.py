    Knowing the contribution of the n particles, a average can be done on that. This function realized that.
    
    flux_local : Actual flux to update - List
    
    fluxpic : same than flux_local but just to compute variance - List
    
    std : Actual standart deviation of the flux - List
    
    ERRORpic : Actual statistical error of the flux - List
    
    n : number of particles that we have simulated - Integer
    
    Q : Intensity of the source - Float
    
    step : the precision on the z-axis, first bin is defined between 0 and step, 
    the seconde between step and 2*step,...etc  - float
    
    sigmatot : total cross section of the media - float
    
    s : 6 first moments of the sampling - List
    
    variance : Final variance
    
    iflux : Results collected for the current particle - List
    
    variancepic : Actual variance to update - List
    
    numesc : Actual number of escaped particles to update - Integer
    
    iesc : 0 or 1, to know if the current particle has escaped - Integer (0 or 1)
    
    numdeath : Actual number of absorbed particles to update - Integer
    
    numscattot ; Actual number of scattering - Integer
    
    iscat : number of scattering for the current particle - Integer
    
    ideath : 0 or 1, to know if the current particle has absorbed - Integer (0 or 1)
    
    Output : same but updated
